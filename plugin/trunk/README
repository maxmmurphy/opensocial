OpensocialContainer
===================

This plugin is designed to pull together all of the neccessary components involved in turning your application in to an OpenSocial container capable of hosting OpenSocial applications.  Beyond the raw functionality this plugin is being built to make the practice of presenting a secure and stable container simple and straightforward by adopting best practices as they are defined.

Example
=======

In the config/routes.rb file:

ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  ...

  map.opensocial_container :contain
end

To add the "feeds" resources:
ruby script/generator opensocial

If you support the OpenSocial REST API already, then use this instead to avoid the pollution:
ruby script/generator opensocial_assets

And finally to embed the container in a ERb template use the helper:
<%= opensocial_container('http://www.last.fm/opensocial/myfavouritemusic.xml') %>

In the config/environment.rb you need to add
OpenSocialContainer::Configuration.person_class = 'User'

to get the support for people to be your "User" class.  The user needs to have:
def self.opensocial_id_column_name; 'id'; end

and should define a title:
def title; self.display_name; end

Caveats
=======
This plugin is in very early development and should be used with that in mind.  While hopefully not too buggy, it may be feature lacking in a number of respects.
